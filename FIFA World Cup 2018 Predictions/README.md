# FIFA-worldcup-2018-prediction
### Using Machine Learning to predict the winner of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
This is my first personal project to practice data mining and Machine Learning techniques. I use mostly pandas, seaborn and scikit-learn. Feel free to take a look at the Jupyter Notebook in the repo to check out the code and the insights provided. I hope it's didatic enough!

### How to visualize the Jupyter Notebook in all its glory
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebooks installed (http://jupyter.org/install).
2. Press the green **Clone or download** button in this repository.
3. Decide if you want to Clone the repo or download it as .zip (I'd suggest downloading as .zip if you're not familiar with Github).
4. Open the Jupyter Notebooks application. A tab in your browser should open up. Navigate to the folder where you saved the repo.
5. Click on the `Predicting World Cup 2018 Winner.ipynb` file to open it.
6. It should work! Now you can explore the code, run the cells you want (remember to run the cells in order, or you may skip initializing some variables or loading some datasets) or even make some modifications in your local copy. 
7. Have fun!
