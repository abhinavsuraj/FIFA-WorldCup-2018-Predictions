    "**Objective**: to create a Machine Learning model capable of predicting the outcomes of football games in the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features**: Results of historical matches since the beginning of the championship (1930) for all participating teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations and obeservations**: I considered gathering data about the ranking of each team for all matches in the dataset; this way we would be able to see if the overall quality of the team impacted on the outcome of each match. However, the FIFA ranking was created only in the 90s, thus eliminating a huge portion of the dataset. I also searched for more ways to assess the quality of each team in each year, but such information was impossible to gather. A realiable proxy would be to average out the rating of each player in a team via their FIFA ratings (the game, not the organization). However, the game also started being realeased only in the 90s, turning this approach impossible. Therefore, for this project in particular, we will stick with historical match records to build a very simple model."

    "\n",
    "As a first experiment toying around with data mining, machine learning and Jupyter Notebooks, I can say that I'm quite satisfied with the tools and skills I learned. However, the model is not without its problems. I highlight below two deficiencies of the way this project was structured:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Lack of relevant features**. There were almost no significant features for our model to learn, only a series of matches between two teams and the outcome. We could think of some more features to be added, but the problem was getting the data necessary from games that are far away in the past. Thus, I sticked to working with a very simple dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Home team / Away team bias**. This is probably one of the biggest concerns. At one point, since I could not determine which were the home and away teams, I simply awarded the team with the highest FIFA Ranking position the honor of being the home team. And as we saw in the historical data, those teams had bigger chances of winning. The original dataset had the home and away features, and if we just stripped down the dataset from these attributes, we would be left with actually very few data points. Ideally, we would be able to give as input to our model a tuple containing the two teams, without distinction of home/away, and it would not have a bias against any of them. This is an interesting point to be developed later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, there are lots of things we could do on this project as next steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "I) **Ensemble modelling**: We could try using multiple learning algorithms in order to achieve a higher accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "II) **More sophisticated feature engineering**: I'm a complete beginner to feature engineering, and to be honest I didn't do a great work in this area. We could try doing some feature transformation or creation on our dataset to increase model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "III) **Dimensionality reduction**: Because of our dummy variables, the training set had a huge amount of features, but they did not mean much. Maybe there's a way to represent this training data in lower dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "IV) **Algorithm tuning**: I could play around the the multiple parameters of the algorithms I tested, and maybe some of them would actually yield a better accuracy than our good ol' logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I hope you enjoyed reading this notebook. I plan on working in new projects, and if all goes well, you'll get to see my skills improving with time. \n",
